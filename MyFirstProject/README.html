<h1>MyFirstProject</h1>

<p>Diana's first attempt to understand frontend coding.</p>

<h3>General Information:</h3>

<p>Project is hosted on azure at: <a href="http://myfirstproject.azurewebsites.net/">http://myfirstproject.azurewebsites.net/</a></p>

<p>Github repository is at: <a href="https://github.com/inmWill/MyFirstProject">https://github.com/inmWill/MyFirstProject</a></p>

<p>Local copy is at c:\projects\myfirstproject</p>

<h3>Helpful Resources:</h3>

<p>Bootstrap CSS Framework: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a></p>

<p>TODO: find more helpful resources (google)</p>

<h3>Workflow Git Procedures:</h3>

<p>Check remote git for any updates missing on local machine:</p>

<pre><code>Open Git Shell and type the following one by one.
cd\
cd\projects\myfirstproject
git pull
</code></pre>

<p>Sync remote git from local:</p>

<pre><code>Open Git Shell and type the following one by one.
cd\
cd\projects\myfirstproject
git add .
git commit -a -m "Brief summary of work done"
git push
</code></pre>

<p>(this will also trigger a deployment and update live site... so fancy...)</p>

<h3>Diana's web dev learning path:</h3>

<p>Phase 1 (<b>Work Complete!</b>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup Development Environment, source control and hosting <b>Completed!</b></li>
<li>Create a simple single page site with minimal html and css formatting (Hello World!) <b>Done!</b></li>
<li>Establish a general workflow procedure for making updates to the site and deploying said updates <b>Finished!</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 2 (<b>Ongoing</b>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Add Bootstrap css framework and format the document to your hearts desire <b>You are here!</b></li>
<li>Add more pages and create simple navigation between them.</li>
<li>Refactor HTML into a template based approach for reusing header, menu and footer components.</li>
<li>Play around with bootstrap jquery plugins for some fun and fancy interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 3 aka Protractor Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Now we combine the two learning paths into one glorious confrontation; the hard fought battle between developers and QAs culminates in an epic battle of the ages. (lets conveniently ignore the fact that you are both developer and QA in this context)</li>
<li>Create a new project in the same solution for testing MyFirstProject (maybe call it, MyFirstProtractorProject, extra bonus points for creativity) </li>
<li>Create protractor configuration and spec files (time to bust out your previous cheat sheet, or bribe Will he likes bribes)</li>
<li><p>Test general items like expected page title, do page links send the user to the correct page, exactly how much free time does William have? (that one will be tricky to test, might need to research some new locators)</p></li>
<li><p>Phase 4 and so on (TODO: come up with phase 4 and so on)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...</p>

<h3>So you've made it this far without closing the document or taking a nap so what's next?</h3>

<p>As you experiment and become more familiar with web development in Phase 2 the following items might be fun to implement, or they could be mind numbing and make you want to set me on fire... Either way you'll be learning. :) (if you're going to set me on fire at least let me have some queso first).</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a content area and fill it with content (redundancy!)</li>
<li>Add a footer to the page and put some helpful copy-write text (don't want anyone ripping off your hard work yo.)</li>
<li>Add a picture to the page (play around with saving it as a smaller resolution in a Paint program or it will steal all your bandwidth)</li>
<li>Add some bootstrap containers or other elements (time to read bootstrap documentation! yay! (is that supposed to be fun? what is wrong with him...))</li>
<li>Add menu links to the right side container that send the user to a new page (now we're getting complicated...)</li>
<li>Add the menu and header items into templates so they can be shared across all the new pages (less repeated code makes engineers happy) (hmmmm maybe we need to schedule another study session) (which is totally not my evil plan) (muahahahahahaha) (why all the parens, they are really unnecessary)</li>
</ul>
